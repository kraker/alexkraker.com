## Summary

A Linux System Administrator with DevOps tendancies. An enthusiastic problem
solver at heart, my experience in IT as well as in other domains demonstrates
a breadth of experience as an analytical thinker, creative problem solver, 
troubleshooter, builder, and engineer. As a whole systems thinker with a 
penchant for working from first principles I've engineered robust and 
fault-tolerant systems to solution real business needs. Notable examples include 
infrastructure access & identiy management, security hardening, and 
configuration & patch management of both Linux and Windows servers. A lifelong 
lover of learning, I'm constantly seeking new challenges, and to grow my skills. 
I'm eager to share my knowledge with others and actively mentor others both at 
work and through community forums.
